# libjaypea

Too many C++ projects became a library. Currently a set of similarly designed networking programs.

## Projects

1. [tcp-client](doc/tcp-client.md)
2. [tcp-poll-server](doc/tcp-poll-server.md)
3. [modern-web-monad](doc/modern-web-monad.md)
4. [ponal-client](doc/ponal.md)
5. [ponal-server](doc/ponal.md)

## Notes

* This is NOT YET a header-only library, but soon all programs will compile only as examples.
* ```etc/``` contains files for these programs that might be shared.
* ```bin/build.sh``` builds all examples/programs.
